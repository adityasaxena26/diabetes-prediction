## Diabetes prediction
 The project aims to use the past medical data records of 2000 diabetes patients in order to build a diabetes prediction model. I analyzed and evaluated many machine learning algorithms based on accuracy and other metrics to find the best algorithm for the prediction task. Given the data of an individual, the model would predict the odds of that person having diabetes.
