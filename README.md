## Diabetes prediction
 The project aims to use the past medical data records of 2000 diabetes patients in order to build a diabetes prediction model. I analyzed and evaluated many machine learning algorithms based on accuracy and other metrics to find the best algorithm for the model. Given the data of a new patient, the model would predict the outcome that the person will have diabetes or not.
